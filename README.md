# REST-Shop
shop REST API using Node.js and mongo

Pull this project and 'npm install' on your machine to finish setup. 
I am trying to teach myself some of the features of Node.js, RESTful services,
MongoDB, and get better with javascript.

I am following a really good tutorial series I will link below (Would recommend).
